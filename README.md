## Codex onboarding fork

### Personal branch

The local `jarvis-personal` branch adds Russian labels for onboarding, chat and primary settings. Choose Russian or English in the app's appearance settings. The conversation screen shows the neural sphere by default. Open **Показать чат** to read the transcript or code. Local Silero and Faster-Whisper detect and transcribe utterances, and completed phrases are read as the model generates them. Code stays in the transcript. Select **Наушники** to interrupt playback by speaking.

Set `speech.tts_backend = "piper"` in the local configuration and provide the ONNX path with `OPENJARVIS_PIPER_MODEL` to use Piper. Install the optional `piper-tts` dependency in the server environment. Codex tools can be provided via `OPENJARVIS_CODEX_MCP_CONFIG`, a path to a JSON file with an explicit `mcp_servers` table. The personal application uses its own profile and loopback port 8148.

On Windows, set `OPENJARVIS_ACCOUNT_BROWSER_PROFILE` to the same dedicated Edge profile used by Playwright MCP. **Источники данных → Открыть отдельный Edge** opens that profile for manual sign-in to webmail and account sites. Close the Edge window before asking the assistant to use the profile. Clicking a source link opens the system browser.

This unofficial fork of [OpenJarvis](https://github.com/open-jarvis/OpenJarvis) is based on Desktop 1.0.5 and distributed under the upstream [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).

The first-run screen offers two new inference sources.

- **Codex via ChatGPT** uses a locally installed Codex CLI. It reuses the current ChatGPT sign-in or opens the official sign-in flow when requested. OpenJarvis communicates with Codex App Server over stdio. This engine returns text and supports streaming.
- **OpenAI API key** sends requests to the OpenAI API with a user-supplied key and model ID. The desktop app stores the key in the system credential store after setup. OpenAI bills this mode through the API account associated with that key.

The public onboarding branch has its own desktop identity and profile at `.openjarvis-codex` with a loopback backend on port 8147. The personal branch uses a separate `.openjarvis-personal` profile. Both retain the upstream local and OpenAI-compatible server options.

### Build the desktop fork

Install the upstream [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/), Python, uv, Node.js 22.22 or newer and npm 11.19 or newer within the npm 11 series. Run the build commands from this checkout.

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle
```

Keep the source checkout available at runtime. Set `OPENJARVIS_ROOT` to this checkout when starting the executable if the desktop app cannot locate it. Install [Codex CLI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/cli) to use the ChatGPT mode.

This branch modifies the inference setup, desktop launch configuration and engine registration. The original project and its notices are retained below.

## Why OpenJarvis?

Personal AI agents are exploding in popularity, but nearly all of them still route intelligence through cloud APIs. Your "personal" AI continues to depend on someone else's server. At the same time, our [Intelligence Per Watt](https://www.intelligence-per-watt.ai/) research showed that local language models already handle 88.7% of single-turn chat and reasoning queries, with intelligence efficiency improving 5.3× from 2023 to 2025. The models and hardware are increasingly ready. What has been missing is the software stack to make local-first personal AI practical.

OpenJarvis is that stack. It is a framework for local-first personal AI, built around three core ideas: shared primitives for building on-device agents; evaluations that treat energy, FLOPs, latency, and dollar cost as first-class constraints alongside accuracy; and a learning loop that improves models using local trace data. The goal is simple: make it possible to build personal AI agents that run locally by default, calling the cloud only when truly necessary. OpenJarvis aims to be both a research platform and a production foundation for local AI, in the spirit of PyTorch.

## Installation

Pick your platform and run one command. Each installer handles [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the Python venv, Ollama, and a starter model — about 3 minutes on broadband.

| Platform | One-liner |
|---|---|
| **macOS · Linux · WSL2** | `curl -fsSL https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/install.sh \| bash` |
| **Native Windows** | `irm https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/install.ps1 \| iex` |
| **Desktop GUI** | Download `.exe` / `.dmg` / `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage` from the [latest release](https://github.com/open-jarvis/OpenJarvis/releases) |

Then `jarvis` to start. The Rust extension and larger models continue downloading in the background; `jarvis doctor` shows status.

Platform-specific notes (WSL2 setup, native-Windows scheduled-task service, desktop prerequisites, manual / contributor install): see the [installation docs](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/getting-started/install/).

## Quick Start

```bash
jarvis                          # start chatting (default: chat-simple)
jarvis gui                      # start the graphical browser interface
jarvis init --preset <name> --force  # replace config with a starter preset
```

`jarvis gui` starts the local API server and frontend, then opens the graphical
chat interface in your default browser. It requires Node.js 22+ and is
available from a source checkout; packaged desktop installers are available
from the [latest release](https://github.com/open-jarvis/OpenJarvis/releases).

> Prefix `jarvis ...` with `uv run`, or `source .venv/bin/activate` first.

| Preset | What it does |
|---|---|
| `morning-digest-mac` / `morning-digest-linux` / `morning-digest-minimal` | Spoken daily briefing from email, calendar, health, news |
| `deep-research` | Multi-hop research across indexed docs with citations |
| `code-assistant` | Agent with code execution, file I/O, and shell access |
| `scheduled-monitor` | Stateful agent on a schedule with memory |
| `chat-simple` | Lightweight conversation, no tools |

Example:

```bash
jarvis init --preset morning-digest-mac --force
jarvis connect gdrive          # one OAuth covers Gmail / Calendar / Tasks
jarvis digest --fresh          # generate and play your first briefing
```

Per-preset deep dives: [morning digest](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/user-guide/morning-digest/) · [deep research](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/user-guide/deep-research/) · [code assistant](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/user-guide/code-assistant/) · [scheduled monitor](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/user-guide/scheduled-monitor/) · [chat simple](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/user-guide/chat-simple/) · or the full [quickstart guide](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/getting-started/quickstart/).

### Skills

Skills teach agents how to better use tools and improve their reasoning. Every skill is a tool — agents discover them from a catalog and invoke them on demand.

```bash
# Install skills from public sources
jarvis skill install hermes:arxiv
jarvis skill sync hermes --category research

# Use skills with any agent
jarvis ask "Use the code-explainer skill to explain this Python code: for i in range(5): print(i*2)"

# Optimize skills from your trace history
jarvis optimize skills --policy dspy

# Benchmark the impact
jarvis bench skills --max-samples 5 --seeds 42
```

Import from [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (~150 skills), [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/skills) (~13,700 community skills), or any GitHub repo. Skills follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard.

See the [Skills User Guide](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/user-guide/skills/) and [Skills Tutorial](https://open-jarvis.github.io/OpenJarvis/tutorials/skills-workflow/) for details.

### Built-in Agents

OpenJarvis ships with eight built-in agents across three execution modes (on-demand, scheduled, continuous):

| Agent | Type | What it does |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `morning_digest` | Scheduled | Daily briefing from email, calendar, health, news — with TTS audio |
| `deep_research` | On-demand | Multi-hop research with citations across web and local docs |
| `monitor_operative` | Continuous | Long-horizon monitoring with memory, compression, and retrieval |
| `orchestrator` | On-demand | Multi-turn reasoning with automatic tool selection |
| `native_react` | On-demand | ReAct (Thought-Action-Observation) loop agent |
| `operative` | Continuous | Persistent autonomous agent with state management |
